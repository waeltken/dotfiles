# Clemens WÃ¤ltken dotfiles

My dotfiles. A mashup of useful configurations and scripts I've collected over the years. Now using chezmoi to manage them.

## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal.

```terminal
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply waeltken
```

After installing, open a new terminal window to see the effects.

Feel free to customize to match your preference.
